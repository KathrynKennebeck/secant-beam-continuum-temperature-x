##Secant-Beam-Continuum-Temperature-x

A secant-based solution to beam elements (with 6 DOFs) connected to a specialized continuum element with a crack down the middle in the local x-direction. The crack is modeled with the PPR cohesive zone model. This version of the code allows the user to specify an internal temperature based on some distribution.
